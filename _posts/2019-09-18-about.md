This project provides a sortable list of datasets that may be of use to journalists. Most of the datasets and descriptions come from Jeremy Singer-Vine’s _[Data Is Plural](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural)_, “a weekly newsletter highlighting useful and curious datasets”.

The original _Data is Plural_ [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0) (and this remixed project) are published under a Creative Commons Attribution - Share Alike 4.0 International [license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
